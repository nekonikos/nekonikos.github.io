                     <p> Surprise! HAHAHAHHAHAHHA. I wanted to share what I want to say in this specific way because it’s what I love to do and I wanted to be creative hehehe (panget sulat ko). I’ve wanted to say this for a while now but now I’m ready! Ever since our friendship started this school year, something in me felt something new again. Ano yon? Well HAHAHAHHAHAH, I’ve been admiring you hehe! Those silly voice messages from you was probably the thing that made me smile the most, it gave me a sense of happiness and positivity in myself because of how cheerful you were. The smiles, the laughs, and the eyes, the way you share your stories to me, the way you were really talkative with me , all of it made me admire you even more. So yeah, crush na crush kita wooooooooo!!!!!!! I’m not expecting that you feel the same way and I will always try my best to understand your reason and I just wanted to express what I was feeling hehe. Byez!
